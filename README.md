### Necessary Software
You will need Android Studio and a Android Emulator.

### Function
This is an app that switches to a new activity when the first button is pressed, and goes to google.com when the second button is pressed.

Creating the app helped me familarize myself with:
- Creating intents
- Switching between activities
- Sending information through activities
- Linking to a designated website through an available browser

### Necessary Software
You will need Android Studio and a Android Emulator.

### Function
This is an app that displays a list of items, and switches to a new activity that contains a picture when the items in the list are clicked.

Creating the app helped me familarize myself with:
- Using ListViews
- Creating layouts
- Uploading images into activities using ImageViews

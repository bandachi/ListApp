# Necessary Software
You will need Android Studio and a Android Emulator.

This is a simple app that takes two inputted numbers, adds them, and outputs the result.

Creating the app helped me familarize myself with:
- Using ListViews
- Creating layouts
- Uploading images into activities using ImageViews
